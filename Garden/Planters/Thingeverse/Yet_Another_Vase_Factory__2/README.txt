# Summary

Hi!

This is a variation of the  <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2537095">Rippled Vase Factory</a>.

It's a customizable thing so i encourage you to play with Customizer and find your favourite vase.

Customizer allows you to set the shape of the vase and the distribution and some variations for the pattern used (some sort of rippled tile)

The Customizer generate TWO files, one with low resolution but useful when previewing the object and another with high-poly resolution that is better for print.

Prepared for printing in Spiral-Vase Mode you can print fast and get nice results.

<strong>Also included a ZIP with 40 STL's!!! </strong>

As always i encourage you to download the SCAD file and play locally in OpenSCAD.

I've made some pics for the files includes so you can choose easily what to print. 

Hope you enjoy printing!

Have fun!
