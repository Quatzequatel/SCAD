# Summary

Feel guilty throwing out those spent K-Cups full of coffee grounds?  Would you rather recycle them and use the grounds in your garden?

Made this to extract the coffee grounds easily and efficiently.  Fits on a standard wide-mouth mason jar.

*A little background...*
I had tried 2 other models on Thingiverse and they either broke really easily or didn't extract all of the grounds (or both).  In addition, they took a lot of effort for each K-Cup processed... so I thought a screw-like device would remove the grounds easily without a lot of effort.

This design works great in PLA as well as PETG (have tested both, pictures above are PETG).

**Note that if you use PLA, you must be careful to let used K-Cups cool down before twisting onto the screw and emptying the grounds.  The high temperature of freshly extracted grounds will deform PLA.  Have not had this happen with PETG.**

Hope you find this as useful as I do... happy printing!

**UPDATE 06/07/18**
I've uploaded new STL models that have better reinforcement under the screw's top.  This allows both models to print with no bridging of any kind.  For the standalone model, this means no supports or bridging and PETG is much easier to use.

**UPDATE 06/11/18**
Added left-handed versions for my south-paw brothers and sisters out there.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: CR-10
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .2mm
Infill: 25%

Notes: 
No supports are needed for the standalone model.  The model with the foil-piercing platform requires supports (see S3D image above).

If printing the platform model that has the large shelf (and requires support), I suggest using PLA unless you have good PETG/ABS kung-fu.

No matter which filament you use, be sure to specify 3 or more walls/bottom/top layers.

*I HIGHLY recommend printing with **7 top layers, 3 bottom, 3 walls** as this gives the best strength.  This will also ensure the foil piercing platform's floor is solid and also gives more strength to the top of the screw in both models.*

Printing both versions in about 9 hours in PETG:

# Post-Printing

Some K-Cups vary slightly and if you find that the liner gets caught on the tip of the screw point, use a nail file to sand it down a bit.  It doesn't need to be all that sharp actually.

# How I Designed This

Designed in Fusion360.  Several versions were tried and tested over several months to come up with the version you see here.
